## Filter By Taxa
See [filterByTaxa](https://github.com/LMBiancani/PlacentalPolytomy/filterByTaxa) folder.

Loci are first filtered from incomplete sequences (for the treeshrew project each passing sequence must have over 33% non N), then are filtered by the number of taxa retained (for the treeshrew project the locus passes if 25 taxa are remaining) and then by the number of groups present (for the treeshrew project all 6 groups must be present).
The taxa to group correspondence table is expected to be a csv file and look like this:
```
group1,taxonName1
group1,taxonName2
group2,taxonName3
group2,taxonName4
```

Slurm submission script: ```filter_SISRS_output.sh``` 
```{bash, comment=NA, echo=FALSE, class.output="bg_slurm"}
cat filterByTaxa/filter_SISRS_output.sh
```
Python script run by previous shell script: ```filter_SISRS_output.py```
```{bash, comment=NA, echo=FALSE, class.output="bg_python"}
cat filterByTaxa/filter_SISRS_output.py
```
