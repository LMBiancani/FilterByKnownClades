Goal: convert a forked repo to a stand-alone repository without loosing any of the tracked history or contributions.
Create stand-alone repository from Zack's github.

- Fork Zack's Repository: https://github.com/LMBiancani/FilterByKnownClades

Locally:
- Pull all changes in Forked repo to local machine
git clone https://github.com/LMBiancani/FilterByKnownClades

On Github:
- Change the name of the Forked Repository (to anything else ex. "DeleteMe")
- Create a new, empty repo and give it the original name of the Forked Repository

Locally:
- Push all changes to Github (you should not have to do anything special because the new repo now has the same name as
the repo this was originally synced with).
On Github:
- Confirm the new repository contains everything it should
- Delete the forked repository

On Andromeda:
git clone https://github.com/LMBiancani/FilterByKnownClades

add gitignore and include Loci folder

Subset Zack's aligned loci to create test dataset:
/data/schwartzlab/zbergeron/SISRS_mammals/filteredMammalLoci
(101,405 alignments)
ls *11.fasta
(2,780 alignement)

cp /data/schwartzlab/zbergeron/SISRS_mammals/filteredMammalLoci/*11.fasta /data/schwartzlab/Biancani/FilterByKnownClades/Loci/
